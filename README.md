# ðŸŒ¸ Project Title: Iris Flower Species Classifier

# ðŸ“Œ Description:

This is a Machine Learning Classification project that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on four key measurements:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)


The project is trained on the well-known Iris dataset, which contains 150 records of iris flowers categorized into three species:

Iris-setosa

Iris-versicolor

Iris-virginica


The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to interactively input flower measurements through a web interface. Based on the input values, the trained machine learning model predicts the most likely species of the flower.

This project demonstrates the practical use of classification algorithms and provides a user-friendly interface to test the model with real-time inputs.
